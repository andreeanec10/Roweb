	Hi! 
My name is Andreea and I am a undergraduate computer science student at Politechnic University in Bucharest.
I am an ambitious person, optimistic, sometimes too communicative. 
I like working in a team, but also on my own.
During two years at the university I liked subjects such as mathematics, data structures,
object-oriented programming, communication protocols and introduction to computer organization and assembly language.
I learn working in C, Java, Python, C++, Assembly, Mathlab(and Octave, but basically they work 
the same way).
